# MySQL Database Backup Script

This script is designed to create backups of a MySQL database. It performs a full dump of the specified database and stores the backup file in a designated directory.

## Prerequisites
- **MySQL:** Ensure MySQL is installed and running on your server.
- **mysqldump:** The script uses `mysqldump` to create backups. This should be installed along with MySQL.
- **Shell environment:** The script is written in Bash, so it should be run in a Unix-like environment (Linux, macOS, etc.).

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository** (if applicable) or download the script file to your local machine:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/lalithbarani/backup_database_script.git
    ```

2. **Make the script executable** (if it isn't already):
    ```sh
    chmod +x backup_mysql.sh
    ```

3. **Edit the script** to configure your MySQL credentials and backup preferences.

4. **Run the script** to create a backup of your database:
    ```sh
    ./backup_mysql.sh
    ```
